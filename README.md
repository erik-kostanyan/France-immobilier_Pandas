# France Immobilier Analysis

Starting from a Kaggle Dataset, this became an end-to-end data analytics project.
After cleaning, transforming and analysing the data in Python with Pandas, NumPy and Plotly, I decided to create a website around this project where I created the backend of the website with Django, Dash and Plotly to generate dynamic and responsive dashboards for the clients to interact with.

This repo contains the notebooks that serve as the root of this project. 
The analysis, and visualisations are collected here in one central location.

## Dashboard website

The final website, that serves as a report/dachboard web app, can be found via the following link:
